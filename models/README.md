## Artifacts

- `models/` contains the trained and tuned ML models.  
  Generated by running the notebook `notebooks/modeling_fraud_data.ipynb` and `notebooks/modeling_credit_data.ipynb`.  

   * Purpose: store trained models (`.joblib`) for reuse.
   * Benefits: separates code from artifacts, makes deployment easier.
   * Example structure:

     ```
     models/
       random_forest_credit_tuned.joblib
       logistic_regression_credit_tuned.joblib
     ```
